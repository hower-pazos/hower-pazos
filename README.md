<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm Hower</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Third-Year Computer Science Student at the University of Adelaide</h3>


There is nothing more important in my life than striving to become the best version of myself while chasing my goals and ambitions. My passion for problem-solving and technology led me to pursue a **Bachelor of Computer Science** at the **University of Adelaide**, where I developed strong programming skills in **Python, C++, and JavaScript**.

Through hands-on experience in **machine learning, web development, and market research**, I‚Äôve built solutions that automate processes, enhance user experiences, and turn data into meaningful insights. From developing **AI-driven tools** to crafting **full-stack applications**, I thrive on turning ideas into reality.

Beyond the technical side, I believe in **consistency, adaptability, and surrounding myself with ambitious, like-minded individuals**. Whether it‚Äôs refining a machine learning model, designing an intuitive user interface, or solving complex problems, I approach every task with a **growth mindset** and a commitment to excellence.
